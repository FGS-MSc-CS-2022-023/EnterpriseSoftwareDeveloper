## Functional Areas

![](./images/functional_areas.png)

Each funcitonal areas has different goals and objectives.
But all functional areas should contain all subgoals (all squares).

## Financial

Budgeting, accounting ... as goals

Enable to investigate trends and drill down to financial
transactions

- Cash flow management via customer order, purchase order
with accounts receivable and payable
- Manage Accounts
- Manage FixedAssets
- General Ledger which consider the all systems
- Budget management for forecasting

- Expense management which handle travel expences and
allowances
- Report time and attendance
- Payroll administration
- Employee Development and Certification to standardize the
emplovees

## Engineering

grids in the plant
- Change management which helps to receive, review, checkand
approve changes

## Projects

- Handle complex project life cycles (Eg. Space Ship
manufacturing)
- Recommended for Project based manufacturing
    - Project reporting on project cost transactions
    - Sub contract management to manage sub contractors
    - Risk management to asses project risk then help to mitigate
them

Exam Hint: What is enterprise software? What are pros and cons?

## Nature of Enterprise Software

- Lengthy Implementation (LOC (lines of code), (fu) functional units)
- Standardizing the Business Process
- Involved Risk (Bankrupt/High Profits)
- Slow Performance at the Beginning
- Total Cost of Ownership is High
- Resistance to Change at the beginning

## Key Considerations for Enterprise Applications

- Scalability: Ensure the application can handle increased workload and
data volume as your organization grows.
- Integration: Evaluate the application's ability to integrate with existing
systems, such as legacy software or third-party solutions.
- User Experience: Look for intuitive interfaces and user-friendly
features to encourage adoption and minimize training needs.
- Vendor Support: Consider the reputation, reliability, and availability of
vendor support for the application.
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO): Assess not only the upfront costs but
also ongoing maintenance, upgrades, and licensing fees.

## Implementation Challenges

- Data Migration: Migrating existing data from legacy systems to the new
enterprise application can be complex and time-consuming.
- Change Management: Preparing and supporting employees through the
transition to a new system requires effective change management
strategies.
- Training and Adoption: Ensuring proper training and user adoption is
critical for maximizing the benefits of enterprise applications.
- Business Process Alignment: Aligning the application with existing business
processes may require customization or process reengineering.
- Security and Compliance: Addressing security concerns and complying with
industry regulations are essential during implementation.

## Future Trends in Enterprise Applications

- Artificial Intelligence (Al) Integration: Al-powered capabilities like predictive
analytics and chatbots will enhance automation and decision-making.
- Cloud Computing: Increasing adoption of cloud-based enterprise
applications for improved scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
- Internet of Things (IoT): Integration of loT devices and sensors to gather
real-time data and automate processes within enterprise applications.
- Low-Code Development: Simplified development tools that enable
organizations to create custom enterprise applications with minimal
coding.
- Mobile-First Approach: Mobile-friendly interfaces and applications
designed for seamless access and productivity on smartphones and tablets.

1. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): Integrates core business processes
like finance, human resources, supply chain, and customer relationship
management.
2. Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Manages customer
interactions, sales, marketing, and customer service.
3. Supply Chain Management (SCM): Handles procurement, inventory,
logistics, and demand forecasting.
4. Business Intelligence (BI): Collects, analyzes, and presents data to
support decision-making.
5. Enterprise Content Management (ECM): Organizes, stores, and manages
documents and content across the organization.
