## Component Based Architecture

Why Component architecture ?

- Enterprise Applications Involved high complexity
- Adopt new functionality in low cost manner
- Easier for new customers to implement
- Existing customer should be able to upgrade to new functionality


## What is Component

Individual module which has following attributes

- Separation - All data and Functions are semantically related
- Interfacing - Which can upgrade with new components
- Standardization - Agreed standard interface

Example: PC
